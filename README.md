# ðŸŽ‰ Fifth Internship Milestone: Exploratory Data Analysis on UK's Road Accident Data ðŸš—ðŸš¦

Iâ€™m excited to share that Iâ€™ve completed my **5th task** as part of my internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**! In this project, I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the UK's **Road Accident Data** to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day, as well as to visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

## Project Overview

This task involved analyzing various aspects of road accidents in the UK and deriving actionable insights that can help improve road safety measures.

### Key Insights:

- **Road Type**: Single Carriageway had the highest number of accidents, totaling **23,061** (74.88%).
- **Road Surface Condition**: **Dry roads** accounted for **67.85%** of accidents (208,967).
- **Urban vs Rural**: Urban areas experienced **64.5%** of accidents compared to **35.5%** in rural areas.
- **Time of Day**: A significant **73.8%** of accidents occurred during daylight.
- **Top Vehicles in Accidents**: The most involved vehicles were **Cars** (245,337), **Motorcycles** (25,066), and **Buses** (25,202).
- **Top 10 Accident-Prone Districts**: 
  - Birmingham
  - Leeds
  - Manchester
  - Bradford
  - Westminster
  - Sheffield
  - Liverpool
  - Cornwall
  - Barnet
  - Bristol

### Suggestions to Reduce Accidents:
- Lower speed limits on **Single Carriageways** to enhance safety.
- Install more **reminder signs** for tyre checks, especially on dry roads.
- Increase **traffic lights** and police presence in urban areas, particularly in the top 10 accident-prone districts.
- Promote **road safety education** and encourage the use of seatbelts and helmets.

## Tools and Technologies Used:
- **Python**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: To manipulate and analyze the dataset.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Used for creating insightful visualizations, including heatmaps and bar charts.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For running the analysis and documenting insights.

## Learnings and Reflections

This project has enhanced my skills in **data analysis** and **visualization** while providing valuable insights into road safety. It was rewarding to analyze real-world data and suggest actionable strategies to reduce accidents on the roads.
